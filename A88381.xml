            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>To adde no more: Many heavy Judgements are threatned
againſt, and have been inflicted upon the prophaners of this day: It was not,
their not trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their Churches (as ſome of the <hi>German</hi>
Nobility thought) but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Lords day (as others) which
brought thoſe deſolating Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that Nation: Some think the Flood
began on the Lords day; from that <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. they were grown ſuch
noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prophaners of the Sabbath. The Council of <hi>Matiſcon</hi> in
<hi>France</hi> attributed the irruption of the Goths and Vandals to their
neglect of this day. My Lords,<note place="margin">Cum oritur veneris ſtella

<hi>Nehemiah</hi> did his indeavour to keep men from this ſin of ſins: When
the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> began to bee dark (for then began their
Sabbath, and in the evening begins ours too, as I conceive) hee commanded the
Gates to bee ſhut; hee did his indeavour, and the Lord remembred him for
Good: Do you yours; this will bee your Glory, your Crown, your Comfort: In
ſhort, <pb n="162" facs="tcp:110821:84"/> as none truly indeavour the ſalvation of their
own ſouls, who indeavour not the ſalvation of more ſouls than their own:
So none truly indeavour the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, who do not
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially indeavour the ſanctification of it by all within their families,
precincts, and juriſdictions: Little do you know, worthy Gentlemen, what

                  <p>3 Soul-murther is the greateſt, next to the blood of
Chriſt; the blood of ſouls is moſt precious.</p>
                  <p>3 There is no life like to the life of the ſoul: The life of
grace is the grace of life; it is the ſweeteſt life, it is the
ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt life, it is the moſt honourable, <pb n="219" facs="tcp:110821:112"/>
comfortable, and durable life.</p>
                  <p>4 The life or death of the body fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the fate and ſtate
of the ſoul to all eternity; and therefore it concerns you much to look after
the lives of your ſouls.</p>
                  <p>5 Till your ſouls bee enlivened, they cannot bee

                  <p>6 Till your ſouls bee enlivened, no duty ſhall be

                  <p>8 Till your ſouls live, indeed you do not live; the Father
of the Prodigal da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſons life from his return; <hi>This my Son was
dead, and is alive:</hi> If my words be of any weight with you; if your own
ſouls bee of any worth with you, Honoured and Beloved, then let this bee your
care and prayer: Your bodies ſhall fall; I dare not undertake to tell you
preciſely where, nor how, nor when: <hi>Utiliter Deus latere voluit illum

<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> for a jovial man, and one who would drink
freely.</p>
                  <p>For his Humility and Affability I might ſay much; hee was
<hi>in honore, ſine tumore, in elatione, ſine praelatione, &amp;c.</hi> hee
knew when to ſtoop and ſtand up, and did both; it is rare to ſee one ſo
high, ſo lowly: ſo well deſcended, ſo free from moroſity and
ſuperciliouſneſſe, and humble-hearted; hee knew that pride was the
badge of an ignoble ſpirit, a ſtinking weed, that's wont to grow and thrive
moſt in the worſt ſoils and ſouls: hee knew hee might eaſily bee too
high, but could never bee low enough; hee would not paſſe by an excellency

                  <p>For his diſpoſition in relation to the poor and needy, it

God would do good to them for the poors ſake; ſure for his Sons ſake: Hee

                  <p>For his Judgement, It was not Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal, nor

ſubmitted to examination, the great <pb n="280" facs="tcp:110821:144"/> Rock of offence:
His opinions ſuch as might ſave him, rather than raiſe him; and therefore
hee truly and duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Lords day: His diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon
divine Ordinances, was very exemplary; with what reverence and fear, ſo far
as man could judge, would hee attend unto the word diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Lords
Miniſters; when by reaſon of the weakneſſe of his body hee could not
come to the ſolemn publick aſſemblies; wee ſaw the willingneſſe of
his mind, that wee ſhould come to him, and therefore had his Invitation (to
us a command) to come often to pray with him, and preach to him every Lords day
evening at leaſt, till the Lord had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtored him to health, or
removed him out of the Land of the living by death; which was done, not without
te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications of his thankfulneſſe. And</p>
                  <p>This was further memorable; There was not that omiſſion of
that family-perfuming and preſerving Ordinance of Prayer, reading of the
Word, &amp;c. in his houſe, as is I fear in many families of quality: It is
true: His houſe was not ſo with God, as was deſired; nor was holy
